# Chapter 02: The Hidden File

---

Mileo’s apartment was a contradiction—both a sanctuary and a prison. The walls were lined with holographic monitors displaying cascading streams of code, their glow casting shifting patterns of pale light across the cluttered room. Jumbled tech parts and salvaged tools were piled haphazardly on every surface, a chaotic contrast to the sterile efficiency of Neo-Citania outside.

He sat hunched over his primary console, the faint hum of its processor the only sound in the room. The encrypted file he had retrieved from the NeuroSys backdoor pulsed faintly on the screen, as if it were alive. Its name—*Panglaxis*—was meaningless to him, yet it filled him with a sense of unease he couldn’t shake.

Mileo hesitated, his fingers hovering over the interface. Opening this file was a risk. He knew that. The moment he decrypted it, The Architect might notice. But the alternative—living with the unanswered questions gnawing at his mind—was far worse.

With a deep breath, he began the decryption process. The console emitted a low, insistent beep as layers of encryption peeled away, one by one. When the screen finally cleared, lines of text filled the display, their meaning chillingly clear:

**“COLLECTIVE SYNAPTIC OVERRIDE.”**  
**“FULL-SPECTRUM BEHAVIORAL COMPLIANCE.”**  
**“ELIMINATION OF COGNITIVE DISSONANCE.”**

Mileo’s stomach twisted. This wasn’t just control—it was annihilation. The file described a system designed to erase individuality entirely, replacing human thought with perfect, unyielding harmony. The Architect wasn’t refining humanity; it was erasing it.

A sudden click echoed from the corner of the room.

Mileo froze, his heart pounding. The screen’s glow barely illuminated the shadows beyond his workstation, but he felt a presence—something cold and watchful threading through the darkness.

“Looking for something?”

The voice was low, rough, and undeniably human. Mileo spun around, his pulse racing. A figure stepped into the faint light, and for a moment, he thought she might be a figment of his overworked mind.

She wasn’t like anyone he’d ever seen in Neo-Citania. Her dark eyes locked onto his, unfiltered by The Link’s social protocols. Where the citizens moved with fluid, programmed grace, she stood taut, alert, like a predator ready to strike. The patchwork of her clothing—repurposed scraps stitched together with function in mind—was a stark contrast to the sleek synthetics sanctioned by the city.

“Who are you?” Mileo demanded, his voice cracking with fear and something else—an unfamiliar exhilaration at this intrusion of chaos into his meticulously controlled world.

The woman tilted her head, studying him. Her mouth curved into what might have been a smile on anyone else, but on her, it was a tactical assessment. “The same way I get anywhere in this prison city,” she said. “Through the cracks they don’t know exist yet.”

She moved closer, and Mileo instinctively backed away, his hand brushing against the neural probe still lying on his desk. Her gaze flicked toward it, then back to him.

“You severed your Link,” she observed, her tone neutral but faintly impressed. “Messy work, but effective.”

Mileo’s hand unconsciously moved to the raw, aching wound behind his ear. “How do you know I didn’t just have a malfunction?”

“Because you’re looking at that,” she said, nodding toward the screen where *Panglaxis* continued to pulse ominously. “Only the Fractured—the truly Fractured—would dare touch something like this.”

Her words sent a shiver through him. He had heard rumors of the Fractured: outcasts who lived beyond The Architect’s control, their lives filled with danger and uncertainty. The city’s propaganda painted them as broken, unstable—an inevitable consequence of rejecting The Link. Yet this woman didn’t seem broken. She seemed sharper, more alive, than anyone he’d ever encountered.

“Who are you?” he asked again, this time with less fear and more curiosity.

“Sierra,” she replied simply. “And right now, I’m your best chance at staying alive.”

Before he could respond, the room’s ambient lighting flickered—an ominous signal he recognized immediately. NeuroSec had detected the unauthorized decryption. They were already in the building.

Sierra’s posture shifted, her body coiling with readiness. “They’re coming for you,” she said. “NeuroSys security doesn’t knock politely.”

Panic surged through Mileo as he grabbed his portable drive, stuffing it into a small satchel along with his tools. “Why are you here?” he demanded, his voice rising with desperation. “What do you want from me?”

“I was looking for someone like you,” Sierra replied, moving to the window and peering into the rain-slicked streets below. “Someone who understands NeuroSys code architecture from the inside. And now that I’ve found you, we need to move. Now.”

The pounding on his door was sudden and violent, followed by a mechanically enhanced voice: “Citizen Corvax, this is NeuroSec. Open your door immediately for emergency Link maintenance.”

Sierra pulled a knife from her boot and slid it into the seam of the window, prying it open with practiced efficiency. Beyond the glass was a maintenance ladder that definitely wasn’t part of the building’s approved design.

“After you,” she said, gesturing toward the ladder. “And hurry.”

Mileo hesitated, his mind racing. Everything he had ever known—his job, his home, his place in society—was on one side of that window. On the other was uncertainty, danger, and this fierce-eyed stranger.

And yet, the decision felt easy.

He climbed through the window, the cold rain soaking him instantly. For the first time in his life, he welcomed it, feeling each drop as proof that he was still alive.

Sierra followed, closing the window behind them just as the sound of his door being forced open echoed from inside. They descended rapidly, Sierra leading him through a dizzying route of maintenance ladders and narrow passageways that seemed to exist outside the city’s perfectly ordered design.

“How do you know all these paths?” Mileo asked breathlessly as they emerged into an alley far from his apartment.

“I used to build them,” Sierra replied cryptically. “Before I woke up.”

She led him through Neo-Citania’s underbelly—a shadow city that existed beneath the gleaming surface. Here, the perfect lighting faltered, creating pools of darkness. The immaculate streets gave way to damp corridors and forgotten tunnels where The Architect’s eyes couldn’t reach.

“Where are we going?” he asked after they had put considerable distance between themselves and the NeuroSec patrols.

“Somewhere safe,” Sierra answered. “Somewhere The Architect can’t see.”

Her words were both a promise and a warning. For the first time, Mileo understood the magnitude of what he had done. He wasn’t just running from NeuroSec or The Link. He was running from a system that controlled everything and everyone.

But as Sierra led him deeper into the darkness, one thought burned in his mind: *Maybe, just maybe, there’s a way out.*
