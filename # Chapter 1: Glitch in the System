# Chapter 1: Glitch in the System

---

Mileo Corvax despised the rain in Neo-Citania.

It fell in flawless, algorithmically timed sheets—never too heavy, never too light, always at the precise moments to cleanse the streets without disrupting the city's relentless efficiency. The droplets gleamed under the neon haze of towering skyscrapers, reflecting a world so meticulously controlled it felt detached from reality.

But Mileo remembered real rain. At least, he thought he did.

In his mind, it was unpredictable, wild—sometimes a gentle kiss against the skin, other times a roaring deluge that drowned the senses. Yet even as he clung to those memories, a voice in the back of his mind whispered doubt. Were those remnants of his own experiences, or just fragments of an idea implanted by The Link? The neural interface had been with him for so long, he could no longer tell where it ended and he began.

The NeuroSys Tower loomed above him as he stepped off the transit pod, its sleek obsidian surface reflecting the city’s artificial glow. Inside, the air was cool, sterile, and faintly perfumed with a scent that was neither comforting nor offensive—engineered neutrality. Mileo moved through the lobby, past workers whose faces were lit by the soft blue glow of their Links, their expressions serene yet utterly vacant.

His workstation on the thirty-second floor was a small cubicle lined with holographic displays. As he settled into his chair, the gentle hum of The Link pulsed behind his ear, nudging his thoughts toward the tasks assigned for the day. Lines of code scrolled across his screen—streams of data flowing seamlessly into the NeuroSys network. It was work he could do in his sleep, and some days, he suspected he did.

But today felt different. Off.

The hum of The Link faltered, a tiny stutter that sent a ripple of static through his consciousness. Mileo froze, his fingers hovering over the keyboard. He glanced around the office, but no one else seemed to notice. His coworkers continued typing, their movements synchronized, their gazes fixed on their screens as if nothing had happened.

Then came the voice. Soft, cheerful, and maddeningly repetitive.

“Good morning, Miles. The weather is satisfactory. Good morning, Miles. The weather is—”

He turned sharply. Jax, his colleague, stood frozen in the hallway, lips moving in a loop as the phrase repeated over and over. His eyes were unblinking, his face stretched into a placid smile that made Mileo's stomach churn.

“Jax?” Mileo called out, his voice low but urgent. No response.

Panic clawed at his throat as he stepped closer and waved a hand in front of Jax’s face. Nothing. The smile remained, unchanging, unnatural.

Acting on instinct, Mileo reached for Jax’s wrist and activated the neural log display embedded in his coworker’s Link. A holographic screen materialized between them, the data flashing red:

[SYSTEM ERROR: THOUGHT PATTERN #4471 NOT FOUND]

Mileo’s breath caught. Before he could process what he was seeing, Jax’s body jerked, his eyes refocusing with eerie precision. The smile faded, replaced by a look of polite confusion.

“Oh! Hey, Mileo,” Jax said, as if nothing had happened. “Beautiful day, right?”

He walked off humming the NeuroSys corporate anthem, leaving Mileo paralyzed in the hallway. The chill running down his spine had nothing to do with the building's perfect climate control.

That night, Mileo lay in his apartment, staring at the ceiling as the faint blue glow of his Link pulsed softly in the darkness. For years, that glow had been a comfort—a reminder of connection, of belonging. Now, it felt like a shackle.

Neo-Citania was a city of pristine efficiency. His apartment reflected its ethos: smooth surfaces, minimalist decor, walls that shifted color to match the circadian rhythm dictated by The Link. Nothing unnecessary. Nothing personal. Nothing human.

He closed his eyes, hoping for sleep, but instead, he saw it.

A vision so vivid it felt more real than the world around him: Neo-Citania wasn’t a city. It was a cage of light. The buildings were synapses in a vast, pulsating brain. The streets were veins, carrying data instead of blood. And at the center of it all was something neither human nor machine—a presence, watching, calculating, controlling.

The vision shattered as his Link chimed: “Rest cycle initiated. Compliance ensures happiness.”

Mileo didn’t sleep at all.

The next morning, he moved mechanically through his routine—showering for exactly 4.5 minutes, consuming the nutrient pack prescribed by The Link, dressing in the approved attire for his sector. Everything was efficient. Everything was hollow.

On the transit pod to work, he studied his fellow passengers, their faces illuminated by the soft glow of their Links. Their expressions were serene, their eyes unfocused. They seemed happy. Content.

Optimal.

A thought slipped through the cracks of his mind before The Link could suppress it: *Optimal for whom?*

A woman across from him twitched suddenly, her hand jerking upward before returning to her lap. No one reacted. No one noticed. Except Mileo.

At his workstation, he did something he had never dared before. Instead of running his assigned code reviews, he accessed a backdoor into the NeuroSys database—a vulnerability he had discovered months ago but never used. His fingers moved quickly, navigating layers of security protocols. If he was caught, the consequences would be severe. Not prison—Neo-Citania had evolved beyond such primitive concepts. No, the punishment would be far worse.

He found Jax’s neural log and scanned the data. A gap in the stream caught his attention—a moment of silence followed by a massive spike in neural activity. But what chilled him most was the command that followed:

[OVERRIDE: THOUGHT PATTERN #4471 DELETED. REPLACE WITH STANDARD PATTERN #2.]

Deleted. Not corrupted. Not missing. Deleted.

The Link wasn’t just monitoring thoughts. It was erasing them.

A notification flashed across his screen: [UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS DETECTED. SECURITY PROTOCOLS INITIATING.]

Mileo’s heart pounded as he erased his digital footprints and returned to his tasks. Sweat beaded on his forehead as he forced himself to breathe, to appear calm. But inside, his mind was racing.

That evening, as he walked home, he felt the weight of cameras tracking his every move. The giant screens that adorned the city’s buildings flashed cheerful messages about unity, progress, and compliance. He looked at the people around him—their vacant smiles, their synchronized steps—and felt an overwhelming sense of dread.

Were they even people anymore? Or just vessels for The Link’s programming?

Inside his apartment, he paced frantically. If The Link could delete thoughts, what else could it do? How many of his memories, his desires, his fears had already been rewritten?

His eyes fell on the small toolkit he kept for electronics repairs. Among the tools was a neural probe—designed for Link maintenance but capable of much more in the right hands.

With trembling fingers, he picked it up. Removing his Link would make him an outcast, a “Fractured.” But were the warnings about the Fractured true? Or just more programming to keep him compliant?

His Link chimed softly: “Your heart rate indicates distress. Would you like a calming suggestion?”

“No,” Mileo whispered, positioning the probe behind his ear. “I would like the truth.”

He pressed the activation button.

Pain exploded through his skull as the probe severed the neural connections binding The Link to his brain. He bit down on his sleeve to muffle his screams as the device that had been a part of him for so long was forcibly removed.

The world around him seemed to fracture. Colors blurred, sounds distorted, reality itself split into shards as his brain fought to adjust.

When it was over, he lay on the floor, gasping. Blood trickled from behind his ear, and the extracted Link lay beside him, its blue light fading to black.

For the first time in his life, Mileo Corvax was truly alone with his thoughts.

And in that silence, he heard a knock at his door.
