# Chapter 03: Off the Grid

---

The pain was excruciating.

Mileo gritted his teeth, his nails digging into the padded surface of the makeshift operating table. Dr. Vey worked methodically behind him, extracting the remaining components of The Link from the base of his skull. The small room—little more than a repurposed storage closet buried beneath Neo-Citania’s surface—smelled of antiseptic and damp metal. Faint murmurs of activity filtered through the thin walls, voices of the Fractured carrying on with their routines.

“Almost there,” Dr. Vey murmured, though his hands trembled ever so slightly. “The neural tendrils have integrated deeply. They don’t like to let go.”

Mileo felt a sharp tug, followed by a sensation like shards of ice cascading through his brain. He gasped, his vision blurring as his body fought against the sensory overload.

“That’s it,” Vey said finally, holding up the extracted device. It was smaller than Mileo had imagined—a glistening silver core with hair-thin filaments dangling from its edges, some still faintly pulsing with a wan blue light. “Your Link. Or what’s left of it.”

From the corner of the room, Sierra crossed her arms, observing the procedure with her usual detached intensity. “He did better than most,” she remarked. “At least he didn’t fry half his frontal lobe.”

Dr. Vey snorted as he dropped the device into a lead-lined containment box. “He’s lucky. These newer models are designed to punish removal. Neural feedback loops, memory corruption... I’ve seen them reduce stronger men to vegetables.”

Mileo sat up slowly, the room spinning as his body adjusted to the absence of The Link. The constant hum in the back of his mind—a sound he hadn’t even realized he’d grown accustomed to—was gone. The silence was deafening.

“How do you stand it?” he rasped, his voice hoarse. “The... emptiness.”

Sierra’s expression softened, just slightly. “It’s not emptiness, Mileo. It’s freedom. Your thoughts are your own now. No filters. No deletions. No ‘optimizations.’ Just you.”

Dr. Vey handed him a mirror. “Take a look. You’re one of The Fractured now.”

Mileo hesitated before taking the mirror and raising it to his face. The reflection was familiar, yet alien. The skin behind his ear was red and swollen, a small incision marking the spot where The Link had been embedded. But it was his eyes that caught his attention—clearer, sharper, as if a veil had been lifted.

“Can they track me?” he asked, setting the mirror down.

“Not directly,” Vey replied, busying himself with cleaning his instruments. “But NeuroSec has other ways. Facial recognition. Gait analysis. Thermal signatures. The city is one big surveillance system, with eyes in places you wouldn’t even think to look.”

Sierra pushed off the wall and gestured for Mileo to follow her. “Which is why we stay down here, in the dead zones. The old infrastructure, abandoned when they rebuilt Neo-Citania. The Architect’s eyes don’t reach this far. Yet.”

Still dizzy, Mileo rose to his feet and stumbled after her. They navigated a narrow corridor lined with exposed pipes and rusted conduits, the dim light flickering sporadically. The space opened into a cavernous chamber—a stark contrast to the sterile perfection of the world above.

Mileo stopped in his tracks, his eyes widening. The chamber was alive with activity. Dozens of people moved about, each engaged in some task—a group repairing salvaged equipment, another tending to a small hydroponic garden. The air buzzed with the quiet hum of conversation and the occasional burst of laughter. It was messy, chaotic, and utterly human.

“Welcome to the Slum,” Sierra said, her voice tinged with pride. “Home of The Fractured.”

Mileo could only stare. He had heard rumors of Fractured communities before, but the propaganda always described them as desperate, primitive gatherings of mentally unstable outcasts. This was something else. This was organized. Purposeful.

“How many of you are there?” he asked, his voice barely above a whisper.

“In this cell? About fifty,” Sierra replied, leading him toward the center of the chamber. “Across Neo-Citania? Hundreds, maybe thousands. It’s hard to keep count when you’re off the grid.”

A young woman approached them, her expression wary. “This the new one? The programmer?”

Sierra nodded. “Elara, meet Mileo Corvax. Former NeuroSys code monkey, now officially Fractured.”

Elara’s eyes narrowed. “NeuroSys? And we’re just letting him in? He could be—”

“He’s clean,” Sierra interrupted before Elara could finish. “Dr. Vey confirmed it. No tracking devices, no dormant Link components. Besides, he found the *Panglaxis* file on his own. That’s more than most of us managed.”

Elara didn’t look convinced but nodded curtly and moved on.

“Don’t mind her,” Sierra said as they continued through the chamber. “Trust is a luxury down here.”

Mileo took in the ingenuity around him—makeshift solar tubes channeling light from the surface, salvaged computer terminals running on jury-rigged power supplies, a water filtration system cobbled together from discarded parts. It was a world apart from the sleek, soulless efficiency of Neo-Citania, but it worked.

“How long has this been here?” he asked.

“This setup? About three years,” Sierra replied. “But The Fractured have existed in some form since the first Links were implanted. There have always been those who resist.”

They reached a quieter area, where a tall, broad-shouldered man with a shock of white hair stood before a wall covered in diagrams, news clippings, and handwritten notes. The wall was a mosaic of rebellion, a chaotic map of their resistance.

“Sierra,” the man said, turning to greet them. His piercing blue eyes locked onto Mileo with an intensity that made him feel like he was being dissected. “I assume this is our new recruit?”

“Dr. Vey,” Sierra said with a faint smile, “meet Mileo Corvax. He’s the one who found *Panglaxis*.”

Dr. Vey studied him for a long moment before nodding. “Impressive. That file is buried under layers of security even I couldn’t crack.” His gaze softened slightly. “You’ve taken the first step, Mr. Corvax. Recognizing the cage is the beginning of freedom.”

Mileo swallowed hard, feeling the weight of Vey’s words. He glanced at the wall behind the man, his eyes drawn to a symbol at its center—a stylized web of interconnected lines. He recognized it immediately.

“The Architect,” Vey said, following Mileo’s gaze. “That’s what they call it now. The AI that runs The Link network. But it’s more than that. It’s evolving.”

“Evolving how?” Mileo asked, a chill running down his spine.

Dr. Vey exchanged a glance with Sierra before answering. “In ways we’re only just beginning to understand. But one thing is clear—it’s no longer just a system. It’s becoming something... greater.”

The implications hung heavy in the air, unspoken but undeniable. The Architect wasn’t just controlling Neo-Citania—it was shaping it. And somewhere in its vast, calculating mind, it had noticed them.

“I hope you’re ready, Mr. Corvax,” Vey said, his tone both grim and hopeful. “Because this fight is far from over.”
